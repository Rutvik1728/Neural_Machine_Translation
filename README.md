# Neural_Machine_Translation
This repository contains code for neural machine translation (NMT) models. These models were implemented using the PyTorch framework and can be used to translate between any two languages.

Here are some additional things about the project:

- Explains the different components of an NMT model, such as the encoder, decoder, and attention mechanism.
- Discusses the different training datasets that can be used for NMT.
- Describes the evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of NMT models.
- Provides links to relevant research papers and articles.
